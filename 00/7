 Project over - took place from Mar 30, 2023 6:00 AM to Apr 5, 2023 6:00 AM
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
In a nutshell…
Auto QA review: 0.0/167 mandatory & 0.0/104 optional
Altogether:  0.0%
Mandatory: 0.0%
Optional: 0.0%
Calculation:  0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%)  == 0.0%
Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Never forget a test


Background Context
Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
Starting from today:

Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
Resources
Read or watch:

doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
doctest – Testing through documentation
Unit Tests in Python
Unittest module
Interactive and Non-interactive tests
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
Why Python programming is awesome
What’s an interactive test
Why tests are important
How to write Docstrings to create tests
How to write documentation for each module and function
What are the basic option flags to create tests
How to find edge cases
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
Quiz questions
Question #0
Is this a standardized way to comment a function in Python?

##########
# Addition function
##########
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

Yes


No

Question #1
Is this a standardized way to comment a function in Python?

"""" Addition function """
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

Yes


No

Question #2
Is this module correctly commented?

#!/usr/bin/python3
""" 
    My calculation module
"""
import sys
...

Yes


No

Question #3
Is this a standardized way to comment a function in Python?

/* Addition function */
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

Yes


No

Question #4
Based on this code, what should all the test cases be? (select multiple)

def uniq(list):
    """ Returns unique values of a list """
    u_list = []
    for item in list:
        if item not in u_list:
            u_list.append(item)
    return u_list

list with multiple types (integer, string, etc…)


list with twice the same element (same type)


not a list argument (ex: passing a dictionary to the method)


list with more than 2 times the same element (same type)


empty list


list with one element (any type)


list with 2 different element (same type)

No

Question #6
